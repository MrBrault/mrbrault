    <h2>Task 1: Website</h2>
    <p>This website was created as a way to share tutorials with students so that they could learn different pieces of software. The most complete piece is for my 2D Animation &amp; Design class. I have a background in web design and I teach it, so I hand-coded the whole page. My code speaks for itself, if you know HTML and CSS, but here is a very high level overview of how the page was created:</p>
              <ul>  
	<li>The domain was purchased using Hover.com and the hosting is through Github pages which is a free service that you can use to host web pages.</li>
	<li>All pages start with Bootstrap which gives the site a consistent feel and makes it responsive (meaning it works well on a large computer monitor or a cell phone).</li>
	<li>I created my own CSS to change a few things such as adding gray backgrounds to the boxes to organize things visually, and used variations of purple as purple and white are the school’s colors. </li>
	<li>The main page allows students to choose the class they are in to find the tutorials they need.</li>
	<li>The next page below that has a list of tutorials that they can follow (this is mostly used for my 2D Animation & Design class, so there is the most content there).</li>
	<li>On each tutorial page there is text, images, and animated GIFs that show how a task is performed. It allows students to follow the steps to learn the software from a very basic level.</li>
	<li>I also have some links out to tutorials made by Adobe for the Illustrator portion of the class. We don’t use Illustrator as much, so I haven’t put in as much time into creating specific tutorials for those.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2 style="margin-top: -5px">Task 2: Photos</h2>

        <p>This is a website I created as a way for students to be able to learn at their own pace which frees me up to work 1-on-1 with the students who need additional help. These are used as an introduction to the content before tackling more challenging tasks.</p>
        <p>The original photo could be used as an example of Rule of Space for the unit on capturing quality photographs. I edited all of the photos by using the Mac app, Preview. I used the marquee tool and chose the portion of the image I wanted to keep, and then pressed command + K to crop the image and saved a copy of the new photo. I also resized the original by going to the Tools menu and choosing Adjust Size and set the width to 640 pixels. I made the original black and white by going to Tools and Adjust Color, then dragged the saturation level all the way to the left which leaves no color.</p>
        <p>The outside photo was taken by one of the other photography teachers, Susana Butterworth, of our colleague, Brent Rust. This is an example of a Triptych photo edit and would be used to teach that editing technique.</p>
        <p>The scanned image is a picture of a camera sign-out sheet that all photography students need to sign. This could be used to show students what they need to complete when checking out a camera. I used the scan feature on my iPhone that is built into the notes app and saved it as an image file. I also resized the scanned image by going to the Tools menu and choosing Adjust Size and set the width to 640 pixels.</p>
        <p>The paint image was done on my iPad with the Notes app. I drew an image that could be used as a banner image on the website using different pen sizes and colors. I used the Apple Pencil to draw the image and then saved it when finished. I also resized the paint image by going to the Tools menu and choosing Adjust Size and set the width to 640 pixels.</p>

    <h2>Task 3: Multimedia</h2>
        <p>This video was filmed along with the other two teachers who teach photography. I was in charge of filming and editing while Susana Butterworth and Brent Rust were acting in the video. The video was produced for our Photography 1 students to teach a composition guideline called Rule of Space.</p>
        <p>In planning out this video we created a storyboard to plan out the video. Creating a storyboard was very useful when working with other people because it allowed us to visualize when the video would look like and more easily communicate the important points of the video. We also had the details worked out before we went out to film which made the filming process quicker. </p>
        <p>When we were finished filming I did the editing with a piece of software called Final Cut Pro. This is a professional non-linear editor. It is the software that I am most comfortable with and it allows for audio editing, text on the screen, motion animation, and transitions. It’s also the software that my students use for my video production course. </p>
        <p>The video is available <a href="http://mrbrault.com/photo/comp/01.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>I also made an audio version of another video that walks students through an assignment about career research. That page is accessible <a href="http://mrbrault.com/photo/intro/careers.html" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
