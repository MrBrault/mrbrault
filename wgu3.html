    <h2>Task 3: Multimedia</h2>
        <p>This video was filmed along with the other two teachers who teach photography. I was in charge of filming and editing while Susana Butterworth and Brent Rust were acting in the video. The video was produced for our Photography 1 students to teach a composition guideline called Rule of Space.</p>
        <p>In planning out this video we created a storyboard to plan out the video. Creating a storyboard was very useful when working with other people because it allowed us to visualize when the video would look like and more easily communicate the important points of the video. We also had the details worked out before we went out to film which made the filming process quicker. </p>
        <p>When we were finished filming I did the editing with a piece of software called Final Cut Pro. This is a professional non-linear editor. It is the software that I am most comfortable with and it allows for audio editing, text on the screen, motion animation, and transitions. Itâ€™s also the software that my students use for my video production course. </p>
        <p>The video is available <a href="http://mrbrault.com/photo/comp/01.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>I also made an audio version of another video that walks students through an assignment about career research. That page is accessible <a href="http://mrbrault.com/photo/intro/careers.html" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
