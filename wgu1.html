    <h2>Task 1: Website</h2>
    <p>This website was created as a way to share tutorials with students so that they could learn different pieces of software. The most complete piece is for my 2D Animation &amp; Design class. I have a background in web design and I teach it, so I hand-coded the whole page. My code speaks for itself, if you know HTML and CSS, but here is a very high level overview of how the page was created:</p>
              <ul>  
	<li>The domain was purchased using Hover.com and the hosting is through Github pages which is a free service that you can use to host web pages.</li>
	<li>All pages start with Bootstrap which gives the site a consistent feel and makes it responsive (meaning it works well on a large computer monitor or a cell phone).</li>
	<li>I created my own CSS to change a few things such as adding gray backgrounds to the boxes to organize things visually, and used variations of purple as purple and white are the school’s colors. </li>
	<li>The main page allows students to choose the class they are in to find the tutorials they need.</li>
	<li>The next page below that has a list of tutorials that they can follow (this is mostly used for my 2D Animation & Design class, so there is the most content there).</li>
	<li>On each tutorial page there is text, images, and animated GIFs that show how a task is performed. It allows students to follow the steps to learn the software from a very basic level.</li>
	<li>I also have some links out to tutorials made by Adobe for the Illustrator portion of the class. We don’t use Illustrator as much, so I haven’t put in as much time into creating specific tutorials for those.</li>
            </ul>
